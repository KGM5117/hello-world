# hello-world

Hello, Im KGM5 (or KGM5117 if my name is already taken)
Im using the guide to make this beginner repository to learn how to use Github.
I only signed up to Github so I can help update and improve the StarLegacy Wiki, so new players to the server won't be as clueless as I was (and still am) I might use Github for other projects if I find this easy.
